    "There are several ways of doing so and neither looks very beginner friendly but as this is a common poblem in economics, I want to show you nevertheless how it can be done.\n",

    "where $p$ is now a vector containing the parameters of the problem which are here the two prices and the budget, i.e. $p[1]$ is the price of good 1, $p[2]$ the price of good 2 and $p[3]$ is the budget. For the code below it is important to write everything as double inequalities and where we have no lower/upper restriction we do this by stating that a term has to be larger/less than (-)infinity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the utility function does not depend on any of these parameters here (although it could in principle) but nevertheless the parameters have to be an argument in the $u$ function if you want your code to run without error. \n",

    "We are almost there. However, the packages we are going to use want us to write all the constraints into one function and do this in a slightly odd format: We define a function $cons!(res,x,p)$ which has as a first argument (\"res\")  a vector that will be set inside the function to the value of the three constraints.
