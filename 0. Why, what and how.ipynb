    "These notebooks should teach economics students to use software to do simple numerical tasks that often come up when writing a seminar paper or a thesis. In particular, plotting functions and creating print quality plots/graphics, solving equations and equations systems (e.g. to solve for an equilibrium) as well as maximization problems. I propose to use th programming language julia as a tool but these notebooks do not require prior knowledge of julia or any other programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that you can simply substitute the functions that I use in my examples with the ones that are relevant to your problem, execute the code and get the result/graphic that you need. There are two caveats:\n",
    "- Everything is about numerical analysis. That is, the code will not give you a formula, say, an equilibrium as a general function of the parameters but it will give you the equilibrium if you choose some specific parameter values. Hence, it is much more suitable to find/solve examples (or counterexamples) than for a general solution to a problem. However, these numerical examples can be very enlightening. For example, they can tell you what (not) to look for. You can also get a rough feeling for how the solution, e.g. the equilibrium, changes if parameter values change.\n",
    "- These notebooks are not meant to teach you programming in general or julia more specifically. I encourage you to learn it in addition when you have time but you might want to check other places on the web for this purpose. In particular, I will not talk about type inference and the type system, writing fast code, multiple dispatch and I will even skip many  standard features of programming languages like, for example, dictionaries. The approach here is to use julia as something like a graphical calculator which harvests of course only a tiny amount of julia's power."
